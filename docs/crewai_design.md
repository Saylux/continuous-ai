# CrewAI Agent Design: Workflow, Error Handling, and Extensibility

## Workflow Design
- Each agent is responsible for a specific automation task (e.g., code sync, test, deploy).
- Tasks are defined as Python functions or classes and assigned to agents.
- Use CrewAI's Crew object to orchestrate multi-agent workflows.

## Error Handling
- Use try/except blocks in agent task functions.
- Log errors to a file or console for debugging.
- Implement fallback tasks or notifications for failed steps.

## Extensibility
- Add new agents by subclassing or instantiating Agent with new roles/goals.
- Add new tasks as Python functions or classes.
- Integrate with external APIs (GitHub, Roblox, Discord) via Python packages.
- Use environment variables or config files for secrets and settings.

## Example: Robust Task with Error Handling
```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

def sync_and_test():
    try:
        # Sync code
        print("Syncing code...")
        # Run tests
        print("Running tests...")
        return "Success"
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return "Failed"

agent = Agent(name="SyncBot", role="Sync & Test", goal="Keep code up to date and tested")
task = Task(description="Sync and test code", agent=agent, function=sync_and_test)
crew = Crew(agents=[agent], tasks=[task])
crew.kickoff()
```
