# Agents Folder

This folder contains all CrewAI agent scripts for automation, CI/CD, and integration tasks in the Roblox Family Feud project.

- Add new agents as Python scripts (e.g., `my_agent.py`).
- Use the examples in the docs for structure and best practices.
- Keep secrets and config out of agent scripts (use `.env`).
